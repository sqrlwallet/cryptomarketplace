## 💬 Maker's Comment (Draft)

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm excited to introduce **Ripework**, a new platform for digital creators.

We built Ripework because we felt that most marketplaces looked the same. We wanted to create a space that felt **alive, raw, and premium**—something that resonates with the crypto and design communities.

With Ripework, we're leveraging the speed and low fees of the **Base Chain** to make digital commerce seamless. No massive platform fees eating into your margins, and no waiting days for payouts.

**Key highlights:**
*   **Design-first:** We spent a lot of time perfecting the Neo-Brutalist look.
*   **Simplicity:** Connect wallet -> Upload product -> Start selling.
*   **Community:** We're building for creators who want to stand out.

I'd love to hear your feedback on the design and the flow! Let me know what features you'd like to see next.

Happy hunting! 🚀
